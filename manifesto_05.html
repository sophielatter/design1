<p1><font size="4.5"><center>The utopizing tension of the origins of design
must be recovered. If this is the allegory
<br>
of a possible transformation, then it should
reach as many people as possible.
<br>
Those people who build our environment
in a state of alienation and thus remain
<br>
partially responsible of its transformation.
The mechanisms lead by the IT revolution
<br>
are presently devouring all ideas to vomit
sellable goods. To begin with, in the next
<br>
decades we must find the right ways to isolate
from this redundancy the transformation ideas.
<br>
In order to achieve that we must separate
them from all those ideas that are generated
<br>
by irresponsible anarchies that deny and
trivialize the drive towards the utopia, thus
<br>
making it impossible to get people involved.
In the meanwhile, it might be worth
<br>
to generalize the idea that: every project
works towards ethics (which can be
<br>
compared to the Hippocratic Oath.).</font></center></p1>
